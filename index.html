                <div class="bordered-container">
                    <p class="song-title">One Step Closer</p>
                    <p>" Released as the debut single and second track of their debut album, Hybrid Theory (2000). 
                        Until 2007, Linkin Park closed nearly every concert with this song, and still remains a fan favorite.
                        Anyone who has listend to this song can tell it comes from a place of rage, the once lead singer of the band,
                        Chester Bennington (RIP) wrote this song to express the anger he felt growing up; not fitting in and getting
                        beat up frequently.  "</p>

                    <p class="song-title">Papercut</p>
                    <p>" Originally released as the third single from their debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), and as the opening
                        track of the record. Papercut does an excellent job capturing the essence of the band by combining multiple 
                        music genres including hip-hop, rock and melody. The song is a thesis of someone always looking out for themselves, 
                        and warning others that they are paranoid.  "</p>

                <div class="bordered-container">
                    <p class="song-title">Faint</p>
                    <p>" This song was released as the seventh track and second single from Linkin Park's second album, Meteora (2003).
                        It entered the top 30 on the majority of the charts it appeared on, and #1 on the US Modern Rock Tracks, 
                        becoming the band's third number-one hot on the chart. The song is about being ignored by everyone and making 
                        yourself heard; it explores the themes of loneliness, frustration and self-doubt. "</p>
