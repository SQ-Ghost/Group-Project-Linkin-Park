                <div class="bordered-container">
                    <p>Linkin Park was formed in Agoura Hills, California, in 1996. Originally named Xero, then Hybrid Theory, the band finally settled on Linkin Park, a play on Lincoln Park in Santa Monica, California. The band's breakthrough came with their debut album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which became the best-selling debut album of the decade and certified Diamond by the RIAA.</p>
                    <p>Throughout their career, Linkin Park has experimented with different musical styles, from nu-metal and rap metal to alternative rock and electronic rock. They've sold over 100 million records worldwide and won two Grammy Awards. The band faced a tragic loss in 2017 with the death of lead vocalist Chester Bennington, but their legacy continues to influence modern rock music.</p>

                    <p class="song-title">One Step Closer</p>
                    <p>"Released as the debut single and second track of their debut album, Hybrid Theory (2000). Until 2007, Linkin Park closed nearly every concert with this song, and still remains a fan favorite. Anyone who has listened to this song can tell it comes from a place of rage; the once lead singer of the band, Chester Bennington (RIP) wrote this song to express the anger he felt growing up; not fitting in and getting beat up frequently."</p>

                    <p>"Originally released as the third single from their debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), and as the opening track of the record. Papercut does an excellent job capturing the essence of the band by combining multiple music genres including hip-hop, rock, and melody. The song is a thesis of someone always looking out for themselves, and warning others that they are paranoid."</p>

It entered the top 30 on the majority of the charts it appeared on, and #1 on the US Modern Rock Tracks, becoming the band's third number-one hit on the chart. The song is about being ignored by everyone and making yourself heard; it explores the themes of loneliness, frustration, and self-doubt."</p>
